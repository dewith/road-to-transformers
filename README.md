# Road to Transformers üåÄ

A [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsMlUkeiZfLcldfkK4Fq-6eBI_zxHplNy) to learn the foundations of deep learning and how to build a transformer.

|  1 |    Stanford CS230 Lecture 1 - Class Introduction & Logistics   |   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PySo_6S4ZAg&list=PLsMlUkeiZfLcldfkK4Fq-6eBI_zxHplNy&index=2&ab_channel=StanfordOnline)   |Andrew Ng explains deep learning's success is driven by the availability of large datasets and powerful computational resources, enabling the training of larger neural networks, leading to higher performance. CS230 aims to help students understand and become experts in building and applying deep learning systems.  |
|  2 |   Stanford CS230 Lecture 2 - Deep Learning Intuition    |   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwQHqWyHRpU&list=PLsMlUkeiZfLcldfkK4Fq-6eBI_zxHplNy&index=2&ab_channel=StanfordOnline)    |    The lecture introduces deep learning intuition and how to approach various projects using deep learning. It discusses the components of a model, such as architecture and parameters, as well as the importance of choosing the right loss function. The lecture also covers the concept of encoding and how neural network layers capture different levels of information.   |
|  3 |    Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)   |   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&list=PLsMlUkeiZfLcldfkK4Fq-6eBI_zxHplNy&index=3&ab_channel=SamsonZhang)   |   In this video, Samson Zhang builds a neural network from scratch using numpy to tackle the problem of digit classification with the famous MNIST dataset. The neural network has two layers: the input layer with 784 nodes and the output layer with 10 units corresponding to the digits 0 to 9. The process involves forward propagation, applying activation functions (ReLU and Softmax), and using backward propagation (gradient descent) to optimize the weights and biases. <br>üë®‚Äçüíª The implementation notebook is named `nn_from_scratch.ipynb`.  |
